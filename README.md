# questionClassification
build a machine learning model for the "questions" classification.   The significance of three files are: "question_classification_taxanomy": the information of this file will let you know the significance of every output classes, i.e. any question is falling into which category of class. "traininig_dataset":  There is 5000 training dataset. You have to build the machine learning model using this dataset. "validation_dataset": The validation dataset can be used for testing your ML model.
